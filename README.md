## Problem Distribution  
Image recognition refers to the technology of using computers to process, analyze, and understand images to identify various patterns of targets and objects. The development of image recognition has gone through three stages: text recognition, digital image processing and recognition, and object recognition. In the field of machine learning, such recognition problems are generally transformed into classification problems.

Handwriting recognition is a common image recognition task. Computers recognize characters in handwritten images. Unlike printed fonts, different people have different styles and sizes of handwriting, which makes it difficult for computers to perform handwriting recognition tasks. Digital handwriting recognition has become a relatively simple handwriting recognition task due to its limited categories (10 digits from 0 to 9).

This experiment involves using a voting model to integrate random forest, AdaBoost, XGBoost, bagged, SVC, polynomial naive Bayes, and KNN models to classify the **MNIST** public dataset and **HWDG** private dataset, and providing experimental results and analysis.  
## Project Distribution 
1. Dataset  
There are two types of dataset, **MNIST** and **HWDG**. The first one is from http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/, which involves four files about people's handwriting digits pictures with a train set of 60,000 examples, and a test set of 10,000 examples. The other is from students who are my classmates(thanks all for your favour * 63), where 630 examples are involved.  
Below is all about how to make a HWDG dataset like MNIST.  
    1.1 check out the types of MNIST files![Alt text](image.png)  
    So, it's really easy to find out that there are three kinds of infomation in it where the first one is 4B(32b) size about magic number, the second is 4B size about number of items which means the differant types of dataset such as trainx, trainy, testx and testy. And the last remaining are all about pictures' lables pixels , and any of them equals to 1B.![Alt text](image-1.png)![Alt text](image-2.png)  
    1.2 change the pictures to grayscale.!![Alt text](image-4.png)  
    1.3 seperate into four files
    At this step, 500:130 is accepted, which is approximately equal to 8:2(train:test).  
    1.4 define a method the load the information of the dateset ![Alt text](image-5.png)
