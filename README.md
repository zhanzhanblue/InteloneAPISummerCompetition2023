Image recognition refers to the technology of using computers to process, analyze, and understand images to identify various patterns of targets and objects. The development of image recognition has gone through three stages: text recognition, digital image processing and recognition, and object recognition. In the field of machine learning, such recognition problems are generally transformed into classification problems.

Handwriting recognition is a common image recognition task. Computers recognize characters in handwritten images. Unlike printed fonts, different people have different styles and sizes of handwriting, which makes it difficult for computers to perform handwriting recognition tasks. Digital handwriting recognition has become a relatively simple handwriting recognition task due to its limited categories (10 digits from 0 to 9).

This experiment involves using a voting model to integrate random forest, AdaBoost, XGBoost, bagged, SVC, polynomial naive Bayes, and KNN models to classify the MNIST public dataset and HWDG private dataset, and providing experimental results and analysis.
